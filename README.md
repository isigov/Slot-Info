TinyKick 0.3 Beta

TinyKick is a custom kick tool for Warcraft 3 TFT 1.26.
A custom kick tool allows for the host of a game to kick other players out of the game. 
This is useful for teamkillers, dropping laggers, etc

What makes it different from other custom kick tools? The incredible 9 KB file size compared to a 4000 KB VCK.

TinyKick also has a very light-weight memory profile thus allowing it to run on weaker computers.
You will not get banned if you use this tool because it does not modify any memory.

Commands (To be typed in the WC3 chat in-game):
/kick playerName - disconnects a player from the game
/exit - closes the TinyKick process

[Important] Wait for the window to hide before typing your commands.

Coded in Visual C++ 2010 Express
